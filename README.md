# Heart Disease ML Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data using machine-learning techniques. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Building with Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Ensemble Models
- Clustering with k-means
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

## How to Use
- Download the notebook (`Heart_Disease_ML.ipynb`) and open it in Jupyter.
- Alternatively, view the PDF file directly (`heart_disease_ml.pdf`).

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to heart disease prediction using various machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to compare the performance of classification models and clustering techniques while exploring the impact of dimensionality reduction.

**Key aspects of the project include:**

Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

*Techniques Used:*

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Ensemble Models (Bagging and Boosting

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Clustering (k-means)

**Objective**: Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models, optimize hyperparameters, and analyze feature importance.
The project is aimed at providing insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease and clustering patient data.
